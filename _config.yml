about_content: |
  I have been an experienced/lead Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript developer and engineer since 2016, and I have been working with AWS cloud since 2018. Before that, I worked as a financial markets trader and had been working in financial companies and a bank for 10 years. Lately, I have been working in fintech, where I have gained valuable experience creating innovative solutions for the financial sector. My background in finance has given me a deep understanding and appreciation of the industry, and I am passionate about leveraging my knowledge and expertise to drive positive change in this dynamic field.
